        <content>&quot;Believe&quot; is a Grammy Award winning global number one,
        Multi-Platinum Dance Song which served as the world-wide lead single for American
        singer Cher&apos;s twenty-third studio album Believe. It is noted for its
        use of a peculiar sound effect on the singer&apos;s vocals, which is referred
        to as the Cher effect today.&#10;&#10;&quot;Believe&quot; was written by a
        number of writers including Paul Barry, Matt Gray, Brian Higgins, Stuart McLellan,
        Timothy Powell, and Steven Torch. The song, released and recorded in 1998,
        peaked at number one in 23 countries worldwide .In the second week of March
        1999, it reached number one in the Billboard Hot 100, making Cher the oldest
        female artist (at the age of 52) to perform this feat. It also was ranked
        as the number-one song of 1999 by Billboard, and became the biggest single
        in her entire career. &quot;Believe&quot; also spent seven weeks at number
        one in the UK singles chart and is still the best selling single by a female
        artist in the UK. &#10;&#10;In March 2007, the United World Chart ranked &quot;Believe&quot;
        as the sixteenth most successful song in music history. The same chart lists
        &quot;Believe&quot; as third most successful song released by a solo female
        musician behind Whitney Houston&apos;s &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;
        and Celine Dion&apos;s My Heart Will Go On - the biggest selling single ever
        for Warner Bros. Records and the biggest selling dance song ever having sold
        over 10 million copies worldwide. It was also the song with most weeks in
        the top ten, it stayed in the top ten for 28 weeks.&#10;&#10;The success of
        the song not only expanded through each country&apos;s singles chart, but
        also most country&apos;s dance charts. In the United States &quot;Believe&quot;
        spent 23 weeks on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart and 22 weeks on the European
        Hot Dance Charts. &quot;Believe&quot; also set a record in 1999 after spending
        21 weeks in the top spot of the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart, it
        was still in the top ten one year after its entry on the chart. &#10;&#10;&quot;Believe&quot;
        was given the featured closing number spot for over 100 performances on Cher&apos;s
        1999-2000 Do You Believe? Tour and then again the closing spot for over 300
        performances on Cher&apos;s epic 2002-2005 Living Proof: The Farewell Tour.
        The song ranked #74 on VH1&apos;s 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s.&#10;&#10;An
        interesting note about the recording of the song revolved around the highly-recognizable
        Auto-tune effect (&quot;Cher effect&quot;) utilized in the verses and chorus.
        Producer Mark Taylor added the effect to Cher&apos;s vocal simply as a lark,
        and in interviews at the time, he claimed to be testing out his recently purchased
        the &apos;DigiTech Talker&apos;. However, it later emerged that the effect
        was not created by a vocoder, but by utilizing extreme (and then unheard)
        settings on auto-tune.When Cher heard the results, she demanded that the effect
        remain in the song, and her original vocal be erased, much to the chagrin
        of her record company, who wanted it removed; upon their suggestion, Cher&apos;s
        response to the record label was &quot;over my dead body!&quot; The vocal
        effect is caused by a pitch correction speed that is &quot;set too fast for
        the audio that it is processing.&quot; &#10;&#10;Chart positions&#10;U.S.
