        <wiki><summary>Blues is a vocal and instrumental form of music based on the
        use of &quot;blue notes.&quot; It emerged in Black communities of the United
        States from spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants, and
        rhymed simple narrative ballads. The use of blue notes and the prominence
        of call-and-response patterns in the music and lyrics are indicative of African
        influence. &#10;&#10;&quot;Blue notes,&quot; also known as &quot;worried notes,&quot;
        are the typically flattened third, fifth, and seventh degrees in a major scale.

        <content>Blues is a vocal and instrumental form of music based on the use
        of &quot;blue notes.&quot; It emerged in Black communities of the United States
        from spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants, and rhymed
        simple narrative ballads. The use of blue notes and the prominence of call-and-response
        patterns in the music and lyrics are indicative of African influence. &#10;&#10;&quot;Blue
        notes,&quot; also known as &quot;worried notes,&quot; are the typically flattened
        third, fifth, and seventh degrees in a major scale. This is what gives the
        blues its inherent minor tonality. From performer to performer, or from blues
        genre to genre, e.g., country blues, the deviation of the &quot;blue note&quot;
        from the actual scale can be greater.&#10;&#10;The blues influenced much of
        later American and Western popular music. It became one of the roots of jazz,
        rhythm and blues, and bluegrass. During the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form
        of the blues, blues rock, developed by combining of blues with various rock
        and roll forms. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/tag/blues&quot;&gt;Read
