        album by the English rock band Radiohead, released in 1997. It reached #1
        on the UK Albums Chart and marked Radiohead&apos;s highest entry into the
        American market at the time, where it debuted at #21. OK Computer expanded
        the band&apos;s worldwide popularity, becoming the last Radiohead album to
        have a delayed release outside of the United Kingdom. As of 2007, it has been
        certified triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. OK Computer
        included the singles &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Karma Police&quot;
        and &quot;No Surprises&quot;.\n\nThe album was recorded in rural Oxfordshire
        and Bath, England with Nigel Godrich, who would work with the band on all
        their future recordings. Although OK Computer was dominated by guitar, its
        expansive sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the
        Britpop and alternative rock bands popular at the time, laying the groundwork
        for Radiohead&apos;s later, more experimental work. The lyrics, by Thom Yorke,
        and the album&apos;s artwork by Yorke and frequent collaborator Stanley Donwood,
        emphasised themes such as consumerism, social disconnection, political stagnation
        and modern malaise, though the band denied they set out to make a concept
        album.\n\n\nUpon its release, OK Computer received almost unanimously positive
        reviews. Consensus among critics was that the album was a landmark of its
        time and would have far-reaching impact and importance. NME gave the album
        a ten out of ten score, and reviewer James Oldham wrote &quot;Here are 12
        tracks crammed with towering lyrical ambition and musical exploration; that
        refuse to retread the successful formulas of before and instead opt for innovation
        and surprise; and that vividly articulate both the dreams and anxieties of
        one man without ever considering sacrifice or surrender. In short, here is
        a landmark record of the 1990s, and one that deserves your attention more
        than any other released this year.&quot; Taylor Parkes of Melody Maker connected
        the album&apos;s release to the era&apos;s feeling of paranoia and alienation
        about millenarianism, and said &quot;It&apos;s as pained and as slow-moving
        as the emotions that inspired it. ... In one way or another, Radiohead have
        excelled themselves.&quot; Q awarded the album five out of five stars, with
        writer David Cavanagh stating that &quot;the majority of OK Computer&apos;s
        12 songs ... takes place in a queer old landscape: unfamiliar and ominous,
        but also beautiful and unspoiled. ... It&apos;s a huge, mysterious album for
        the head and soul.&quot; Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that &quot;Others may end
        up selling more, but in 20 years time I&apos;m betting OK Computer will be
        seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully
        revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era.&quot; In a four
        out of five stars review, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that the
        album &quot;is surprising and sometimes inspiring but its intensity makes
        for a demanding listen.&quot;\n\nThe album was also favourably received by
        critics in North America. Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars.
        Reviewer Mark Kemp wrote that the album is &quot;a stunning art-rock tour
        de force ... On OK Computer, Radiohead take the ideas they had begun toying
        with on The Bends into the stratosphere. ... OK Computer is evidence that
        Radiohead are one rock band still willing to look the devil square in the
        eyes&quot;, but warned &quot;OK Computer is not an easy listen.&quot; An Entertainment
        Weekly review by David Browne gave the album a B+, and wrote that &quot;When
        the arrangements and lyrics meander or sprout pretensions, the album grows
        ponderous and soggy. For all of Radiohead&apos;s growing pains, though, their
        aim \u2014 to take British pop to a heavenly new level \u2014 is true.&quot;
        In an article for The New Yorker, writer Alex Ross praised OK Computer for
        its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead&apos;s risk-taking with the
        more musically conservative &quot;dadrock&quot; of their contemporaries Oasis.
        Ross wrote that &quot;Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are
        extreme  This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts
        in the history of rock.&quot; Ryan Schreiber wrote, in a highly enthusiastic
        ten out of ten review in his online music magazine Pitchfork, that &quot;Radiohead&apos;s
        third piece of incredible work, OK Computer, is not only their best yet, but
        one of the year&apos;s greatest releases. The record is brimming with genuine
        emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once
        passive and fire-breathing.&quot;\n\nDespite OK Computer&apos;s widespread
        praise, it also received some criticism. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice
        granted OK Computer a B\u2212 but ranked it as the &quot;Dud of the Month&quot;
        in his consumer guide; Christgau commented that the album lacked &quot;soul&quot;,
        calling it &quot;arid&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot; and comparing it unfavourably
        to Pink Floyd. Andy Gill wrote for The Independent in an otherwise positive
        review, &quot;For all its ambition, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive
        as The Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with
        better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love,
        an album that so luxuriates in its despondency&quot;. While a review in Time
        was largely positive, particularly praising the songs &quot;Airbag&quot;,
        &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, and &quot;Let Down&quot;, reviewer Christopher
        John Farley criticised the second half of the album. Farley stated, &quot;While
        the first half-dozen tracks reward repeated listenings with melodies that
        grow and bloom with familiarity, there is often no structure to be found in
        the remaining half-dozen numbers.&quot;\n\nAt the end of 1997, OK Computer
        appeared in many critics&apos; lists and listener polls for best album of
        the year. OK Computer topped the year-end polls of the magazines Mojo, Vox,
        Entertainment Weekly, Hot Press, Muziekkrant OOR, HUMO, Eye Weekly, and Inpress,
        and tied for first place with Daft Punk&apos;s Homework in The Face. The album
        placed second in NME, Melody Maker, Rolling Stone, Village Voice, Spin and
        Uncut. Q and Les Inrockuptibles both listed OK Computer in their unranked
        year-end polls. OK Computer was a nominee for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious
        award recognizing the best British or Irish album of the year. The album was
        nominated in the Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Performance
        categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the latter award.\n\nOK
        Computer first appeared in a &quot;best of all time&quot; list three months
        after its release, placing 16 in a chart based on submissions by customers
        of Virgin Megastores. This chart heavily favoured recent releases, which suggested
        that OK Computer&apos;s popularity was a passing fad. However, OK Computer
        has since appeared frequently in professional lists of greatest albums. In
        early 1998, OK Computer topped a Q reader&apos;s poll of the greatest albums
        of all time, and in 2001 Q placed it at number one in a list of the top 50
        pop albums of the last 15 years. A number of publications, including NME,
        Melody Maker, Spin, Alternative Press, Pitchfork Media, and Time placed OK
        Computer prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time.
        In 2003, the album was ranked number 162 on Rolling Stone magazine&apos;s
        list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Additionally, retrospective reviews
        from The A.V. Club and Slant Magazine have received the album favourably;
        likewise, Rolling Stone gave the album five stars in the 2004 Rolling Stone
        Album Guide, with critic Rob Sheffield saying &quot;Radiohead was claiming
        the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and
        fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody
        else was even bothering.&quot;\n\n\nOK Computer was recorded in the lead up
        to the 1997 general election. It was thus seen by critics as encompassing
        public opinion through its &quot;despairing-yet-hopeful tone&quot; and themes
        of alienation. Yorke said his lyrics had been affected by reading a book about
        the two decades of Conservative government which were just coming to an end
        in 1997, as well as about factory farming and globalisation. However, in interviews
        Yorke expressed little hope things would change under the &quot;New Labour&quot;
        government of Tony Blair. With the approach of the year 2000, many people
        felt the tone of the album was millennial.\n\nSome critics have credited OK
        Computer with &quot;killing&quot; 1990s Britpop, as within a few years of
        its release, the dominant style of UK guitar pop had become slower and more
        melancholy. Many of the newer acts used similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements.
        The band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of The
        Man Who, which became the biggest selling album of 1999 in the UK. Others
        have credited Radiohead with beginning a mainstream revival of progressive
        rock and ambitious concept albums, though the band denied their affiliation
        with the genre. Radiohead described the prevalence of bands that &quot;sound
        like us&quot; as one reason to break with the style of OK Computer for their
        next album, Kid A. When asked by MTV interviewer Gideon Yago what the band
        thought of &quot;bands like Travis, Coldplay, and Muse ... making a career
        sounding exactly like Radiohead did in 1997&quot;, Yorke replied &quot;Good
        luck with &apos;Kid A&apos;!&quot;.\n\nSeveral rock bands which later became
        popular, ranging from Coldplay and Bloc Party to TV on the Radio, have said
        they were formatively influenced by OK Computer\u2014TV on the Radio&apos;s
        debut album, for instance, was titled OK Calculator. Additionally, the album&apos;s
        popularity paved the way for British alternative rock bands such as Muse,
        Snow Patrol, and Keane. Classical and jazz musicians such as Christopher O&apos;Riley
        and Brad Mehldau have performed material from OK Computer, and composer Esa-Pekka
        Salonen said &quot;When I heard &apos;OK Computer,&apos; after five minutes
        I said, &apos;I actually get this. I understand what these people are trying
        to do.&apos; And what they were trying was not so drastically different from
        what I was trying to do.&quot; Radiodread is a song for song cover of the
        album in a Reggae style.\n\nOK Computer has received great acclaim from the
        public and critics. It is often cited as Radiohead&apos;s best work and as
        a landmark album of its time. In 1998, it was nominated for a Grammy Award
        as Album of the Year, and won for Best Alternative Music Album. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer&quot;&gt;Read
