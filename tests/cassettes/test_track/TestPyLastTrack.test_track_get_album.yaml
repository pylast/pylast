        <summary>&quot;Lithium&quot; is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana,
        written by frontman Kurt Cobain. The name of the song is often attributed
        to the usage of lithium salts as mood stabilizers. Because of this the lyrics
        are often interpreted as describing bipolar disorder. Cobain is said to have
        had bipolar disorder, which may have led to the writing of the song &quot;Lithium&quot;.
        Still, there is much disagreement about the exact meaning and interpretation
        of it.&#10;&#10;In the Nevermind press kit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Lithium&quot;&gt;Read

        Still, there is much disagreement about the exact meaning and interpretation
        of it.&#10;&#10;In the Nevermind press kit, Cobain said this about the song:
        &quot;People who are secluded for so long go insane, and as a last resort
        they often use religion to keep alive. In the song, the guy&apos;s lost his
        girl and his friends and he&apos;s brooding. He&apos;s decided to find God
        before he kills himself. It&apos;s hard for me to understand the need for
        a vice like that, but I can appreciate it too. People need vices.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bruce
        Lash did a mellow version that was used in the movie Marley &amp; Me. He told
        Songfacts: &quot;I was looking for songs that were hard or angry or alienated
        to make sort of loungy Bossa Novas out of. Calm them down&quot;&#10;(Lithium
