Getting started
---------------

Here's some simple code example to get you started. In order to create any object from pyLast, you need a `Network` object which represents a social music network that is Last.fm or any other API-compatible one. You can obtain a pre-configured one for Last.fm and use it as follows:

```python
import pylast

# You have to have your own unique two values for API_KEY and API_SECRET
# Obtain yours from https://www.last.fm/api/account/create for Last.fm
API_KEY = "b25b959554ed76058ac220b7b2e0a026"  # this is a sample key
API_SECRET = "425b55975eed76058ac220b7b4e8a054"

# In order to perform a write operation you need to authenticate yourself
username = "your_user_name"
password_hash = pylast.md5("your_password")

network = pylast.LastFMNetwork(api_key=API_KEY, api_secret=API_SECRET,
                               username=username, password_hash=password_hash)

# Now you can use that object everywhere
artist = network.get_artist("System of a Down")
artist.shout("<3")


track = network.get_track("Iron Maiden", "The Nomad")
track.love()
track.add_tags(("awesome", "favorite"))

# Type help(pylast.LastFMNetwork) or help(pylast) in a Python interpreter
# to get more help about anything and see examples of how it works
```

Testing
-------

The [tests/](tests/) directory contains integration and unit tests with Last.fm, and plenty of code examples.

For integration tests you need a test account at Last.fm that will become cluttered with test data, and an API key and secret. Either copy [example_test_pylast.yaml](example_test_pylast.yaml) to test_pylast.yaml and fill out the credentials, or set them as environment variables like:

```sh
export PYLAST_USERNAME=TODO_ENTER_YOURS_HERE
export PYLAST_PASSWORD_HASH=TODO_ENTER_YOURS_HERE
export PYLAST_API_KEY=TODO_ENTER_YOURS_HERE
export PYLAST_API_SECRET=TODO_ENTER_YOURS_HERE
```

To run all unit and integration tests:
```sh
pip install pytest flaky mock
pytest
```

Or run just one test case:
```sh
pytest -k test_scrobble
```

To run with coverage:
```sh
pytest -v --cov pylast --cov-report term-missing
coverage report # for command-line report
coverage html   # for HTML report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

Logging
-------

To enable from your own code:

```python
import logging
import pylast

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

network = pylast.LastFMNetwork(...)
```

To enable from pytest:

```sh
pytest --log-cli-level debug -k test_album_search_images
```
