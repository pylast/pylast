## Features

 * Simple public interface.
 * Access to all the data exposed by the Last.fm web services.
 * Scrobbling support.
 * Full object-oriented design.
 * Proxy support.
 * Internal caching support for some web services calls (disabled by default).
 * Support for other API-compatible networks like Libre.fm.


## Getting started

Here's some simple code example to get you started. In order to create any object from
pyLast, you need a `Network` object which represents a social music network that is
Last.fm or any other API-compatible one. You can obtain a pre-configured one for Last.fm
and use it as follows:

```python
import pylast

# You have to have your own unique two values for API_KEY and API_SECRET
# Obtain yours from https://www.last.fm/api/account/create for Last.fm
API_KEY = "b25b959554ed76058ac220b7b2e0a026"  # this is a sample key
API_SECRET = "425b55975eed76058ac220b7b4e8a054"

network = pylast.network_via_web_auth(
    api_key=API_KEY,
    api_secret=API_SECRET,
)

# Now you can use that object everywhere
track = network.get_track("Iron Maiden", "The Nomad")
track.love()
track.add_tags(("awesome", "favorite"))

# Type help(pylast.LastFMNetwork) or help(pylast) in a Python interpreter
# to get more help about anything and see examples of how it works
```

More examples in
<a href="https://github.com/hugovk/lastfm-tools">hugovk/lastfm-tools</a> and
[tests/](https://github.com/pylast/pylast/tree/main/tests).

## Testing

The [tests/](https://github.com/pylast/pylast/tree/main/tests) directory contains
integration and unit tests with Last.fm, and plenty of code examples.

For integration tests you need a test account at Last.fm that will become cluttered with
test data, and an API key and secret. Either copy
[example_test_pylast.yaml](example_test_pylast.yaml) to test_pylast.yaml and fill out
the credentials, or set them as environment variables like:

```sh
export PYLAST_USERNAME=TODO_ENTER_YOURS_HERE
export PYLAST_PASSWORD_HASH=TODO_ENTER_YOURS_HERE
export PYLAST_API_KEY=TODO_ENTER_YOURS_HERE
export PYLAST_API_SECRET=TODO_ENTER_YOURS_HERE
```

To run all unit and integration tests:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -e ".[tests]"
pytest
```

Or run just one test case:

```sh
pytest -k test_scrobble
```

To run with coverage:

```sh
pytest -v --cov pylast --cov-report term-missing
coverage report # for command-line report
coverage html   # for HTML report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Logging

To enable from your own code:

```python
import logging
import pylast

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)


network = pylast.LastFMNetwork(...)
```

To enable from pytest:

```sh
pytest --log-cli-level info -k test_album_search_images
```

To also see data returned from the API, use `level=logging.DEBUG` or
`--log-cli-level debug` instead.
